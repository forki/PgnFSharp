PgnFSharp
=========

This is a set of tools for chess PGN files using F#.

A much more comprehensive tool is the excellent [pgn.net](https://github.com/iigorr/pgn.net) by Igor Lankin. 

This version is very much simplified and only outputs the moves of the game and a limited set of the tags.

Binaries can be found as Artifacts from the AppVeyor build - please follow the AppVeyor link above.
