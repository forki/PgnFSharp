ScidNET
=======

This is a set of tools for chess PGN files using F#.

This is based heavily on the excellent [pgn.net](https://github.com/iigorr/pgn.net) by Igor Lankin. 

The only significant changes are that the PGN is parsed to F# types.

Binaries can be found as Artifacts from the AppVeyor build - please follow the AppVeyor link above.
